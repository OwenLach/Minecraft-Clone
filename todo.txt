Core Concepts for Multithreading Chunks:

    Thread Pool: Instead of creating a new thread for each chunk, which can be inefficient due to thread creation/destruction overhead, use a thread pool. This allows you to reuse a fixed number of threads.
    Producer-Consumer Pattern:
        Producers: The main thread (or the World::update() function) will produce chunk generation/mesh update tasks.
        Consumers: The worker threads in the thread pool will consume these tasks.
    Synchronization: You'll need mechanisms to ensure data integrity and prevent race conditions.
        Mutexes: Protect shared data (like the loadedChunks map, or adding vertices to a chunk's mesh) from simultaneous access by multiple threads.
        Condition Variables: Used to signal between threads (e.g., when a chunk's mesh is ready to be uploaded to the GPU).
    GPU Upload on Main Thread: OpenGL calls (like glBufferData, glVertexAttribPointer, etc.) must be done on the main thread (the one with the OpenGL context). This means the worker threads will generate the mesh data, but the upload of that data to the GPU will be a task for the main thread.
    Chunk States: Introduce states for chunks to manage their lifecycle:
        GENERATING_TERRAIN: Initial state, noise generation.
        GENERATING_MESH: Mesh data creation.
        READY_FOR_UPLOAD: Mesh data is generated and ready for main thread upload.
        LOADED: Fully active and rendered.

Refactoring World.h and World.cpp (Conceptual):
    World.h:
        Add a std::queue<ChunkCoord> for chunks that need terrain generation.
        Add a std::queue<Chunk*> for chunks whose meshes are ready for GPU upload.
        Add a std::mutex to protect these queues.
        Add std::condition_variable if you want to signal between threads for task completion.
        Introduce a ThreadPool class (you'll need to implement this or use a library).
        Modify loadedChunks to hold std::shared_ptr<Chunk> or std::unique_ptr<Chunk> but ensure proper synchronization if accessing it from multiple threads. A std::map<ChunkCoord, std::unique_ptr<Chunk>> with a mutex protecting it is a common approach.

    World.cpp (update function):
        When a new chunk is to be loaded:
            Add it to loadedChunks (e.g., as a nullptr or with an initial state).
            Submit a task to the ThreadPool to generate its terrain. This task will involve calling a Chunk::generateTerrain() function (modified to be thread-safe).
            Once terrain generation is done, the worker thread will set the chunk's state and potentially add it to a readyForMeshGenerationQueue.
        Iterate through the readyForMeshGenerationQueue (protected by a mutex) and submit tasks for mesh generation.
        Iterate through a readyForUploadQueue (protected by a mutex). For each chunk in this queue:
            Perform the updateMesh() (which now only does GPU upload).
            Set the chunk's state to LOADED.
        Handle unloading of chunks (similar to before, but ensure any pending tasks for these chunks are cancelled or gracefully completed).

Refactoring Chunk.h and Chunk.cpp:

    Chunk.h:
        Add an enum class ChunkState { EMPTY, TERRAIN_GENERATING, TERRAIN_GENERATED, MESH_GENERATING, MESH_READY_FOR_UPLOAD, LOADED };
        Add ChunkState currentState;
        A std::vector<float> meshDataBuffer; to temporarily store the generated mesh data before it's uploaded to the GPU. This avoids vertices (which is std::vector<Vertex>) being shared directly between threads, as Vertex might involve glm::vec3 which isn't always trivial to flatten for glBufferData.
        Consider a std::atomic<bool> isDirty; or a mutex if isDirty can be modified by both main and worker threads. std::atomic is usually fine for simple boolean flags.
        Consider removing modelMatrixDirty and modelMatrix from the chunk; the model uniform can be set once per chunk draw call in World::render() using the chunkToWorldCoords to calculate it on the fly, or if performance is critical, calculated once and stored in the World if the chunk's position is static.

    Chunk.cpp:

        Chunk::updateMesh():
            Rename: Consider renaming updateMesh to uploadMeshToGPU or similar, to reflect its new purpose.
            This function will only be called on the main thread.
            It will take the meshDataBuffer and upload it to the VBO.
            configureVertexAttributes() will still be called here.
            Set isDirty = false; after upload.
            Set currentState = ChunkState::LOADED;

        Chunk::generateMesh() (Modified):
            This function will be called on a worker thread.
            It will not touch any OpenGL functions.
            It will populate the meshDataBuffer (the std::vector<float> you added).
            After generation, it will set currentState = ChunkState::MESH_READY_FOR_UPLOAD; and notify the main thread (e.g., by pushing this to the World's readyForUploadQueue).
            vertices.clear() and vertices.reserve() would be on meshDataBuffer now.
            The loop for converting Vertex to float will still exist but will write to meshDataBuffer.

        Chunk::generateTerrain() (Modified):
            This function will also be called on a worker thread.
            It populates the blocks array.
            After terrain generation, it will set currentState = ChunkState::TERRAIN_GENERATED; and enqueue a mesh generation task for itself in the thread pool.

        Chunk::getBlockAt() and getNeighborBlockType():
            These functions need to be thread-safe if called by multiple worker threads simultaneously. Since blocks is a std::vector and read-only during mesh generation (after generateTerrain finishes), it's generally safe for multiple readers. If you allow modifying blocks while other threads read, you'll need a mutex around blocks. For initial generation, it's typically fine.
            world->getBlockAt() needs to be thread-safe. This means World::loadedChunks needs to be protected by a mutex if accessed by multiple threads.

        setBlockAt():
            This function currently does nothing, but if it were to modify the blocks array, it would need to make the chunk isDirty = true and ensure thread safety if called concurrently.
