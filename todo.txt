Core Responsibilities of the World Class
1. Chunk Management

    Store all loaded chunks.

    Load new chunks as needed.

    Unload distant chunks (optional, for optimization).

2. Coordinate Translation

    Convert world coordinates to chunk-local coordinates and chunk positions.

3. Block Access

    Get/set a block at a global position.

    Rebuild chunk meshes when blocks change.

4. World Generation

    Generate terrain using noise (e.g., Perlin).

    Populate newly created chunks with block data.
