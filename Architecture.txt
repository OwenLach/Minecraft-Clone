Migration Strategy
Phase 1: Extract ChunkManager

Move chunk collection and lifecycle to ChunkManager
Update all chunk access to go through ChunkManager
Test chunk loading/unloading still works

Phase 3: Extract MeshGenerator

Move meshing logic to MeshGenerator
Update mesh generation pipeline
Test mesh quality and performance

Phase 4: Extract ChunkRenderer

Move rendering logic to ChunkRenderer
Update render loop to use ChunkRenderer
Test rendering performance and quality

Phase 5: Refactor World

Update World to coordinate between systems
Simplify threading model
Add system configuration and monitoring

This architecture provides a solid foundation for a scalable, maintainable voxel world system while preserving the performance characteristics of the original implementation.`
